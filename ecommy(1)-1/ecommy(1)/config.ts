/**
 * API Key Configuration
 *
 * This file centralizes the API key management for the application.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * The Google Gemini API key is sourced from an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`)
 * for security and flexibility. Do NOT hardcode your API key in this file or anywhere
 * in the source code.
 *
 * The environment running this application is responsible for providing the `API_KEY`.
 * This application is already configured to use it automatically.
